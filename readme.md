#Group Project (Assignment 14)

Create a restaurant webpage, using a combination of html markup, js, css, and remote json API data. 

##Step 1
* Ralph lays out basic html blocking (solid background colors for divs to show locations).  

* Monica & Mychelle search web for images. 

* Phil continues laying out html elements. 

##Step 2 
* Monica creates custom menu in json format, works with Mychelle on Reservation form, skeletal $.ajax calls.

* Phil continues html entries, creates custom text for "Our Story" div. He also researched and implemented the iframe for the google maps inset. 

* Mychelle cleans up overall CSS, creates restaurant logo in photoshop, works with Monica on reservation form, skeletal $.ajax calls. 

* Ralph creates newsletter json file, establishes remote hosting site for custom json, helps with debugging of menu.json, and uploads files to server. 

##Step 3
* Monica works on photo carousel--js/html/css for 'hero' div.

* Phil works on creating carousels for sidebar images.

* Mychelle focuses on tab panel js/html/css. Creates click handlers & show/hide coding. 

* Ralph works on retrieving json from API, Mustache templating for news, Specials, main restaurant menu. 

##Step 4 (remote)
* Monica finishes hero carousel

* Mychelle finishes tab menu & divs

* Ralph struggles with functional js to create single Mustache/menu template. Fails, goes to plan B. 

* Phil leaves team ( we will miss his laugh, and his daily memes!)

##Step 5 (meet at TIY Sunday)
Merge code into master branch on remote, push a few css layout changes, fix merge conflicts. 

##Step 6 (remote) 
Monica/Mychelle polish visuals, Ralph writes this readme, adds food icons, and adds css styling to menu.
